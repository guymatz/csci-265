\item \textbf{Use the Pumping Lemma to prove that the following languages are nonregular:}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $L = \{a^ib^j a^i | i , j >=0\}$
	
	\item $L = \{a^ib^ja^j | i , j >=0\}$ 
	
	\item $L = \{a^ib^ja^j | i , j >=1\}$
	
	
	\item The language consisting of all words which can be broken into the same string repeated twice, e.g., $abbabb$ or $baabbbaabb$
	
	\item $(a+b)^ia^i$
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\item \textbf{Explain why the pumping lemma won't work on the following languages (i.e., show where it fails - it's already obvious they're regular because the first 2 are finite and the last 2 are regular expressions)}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The empty set
	
	\item $\{00,11\}$
	
	\item $\{00+11\}\kleene$
	
	\item $01\kleene 01 \kleene$
\end{enumerate}


\newpage
\item \textbf{Use the Myhill-Nerode theorem to determine if the language $(a+b)^i (b+c)^i$ is regular.:}
\\\\

\newpage
\item \textbf{Prove the following languages are nonregular, once using the pumping lemma and once using the Myhill-Nerode theorem}
\\\\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The language where the longest string of consecutive $a$'s is longer than the longest string of consecutive $b$'s
	
	\item $a^ib^jc^k$, where $k \leq i+j$
	
	\item $a^ib^jc^k$, where $i$ is neither the least nor greatest out of $i,j$, and $k$.
	
	\item The language consisting of all strings of $a$'s and $b$'s in which the total number of $a$'s is greater than the total number of $b$'s.
	
	\item The language where a word may have any number of $a$'s and $b$'s in any order, but may (or may not) contain 1 "$c$". If it contains a "$c$", it must be in the first half of the string (in odd-length strings this means at or before the middle character).
	
\end{enumerate}


\newpage
\item \textbf{
	Consider the following languages: PRIME 
	$= \{a^i$ where $i$ is a prime number\},
    PRIME' $ = \{a^i$ where $i$ is not prime\}
}
\\\\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove that PRIME' is nonregular (hint: prove that PRIME is nonregular first - this is a challenge, since you'll have to choose your pumping factor $K$ in a very clever way)
	
	\item Show that PRIME' does satisfy the pumping lemma (that is, it can't be proven nonregular using the pumping lemma)
	
	\item How can this be?
